# jQuery Server-Side Calculator

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Project Description

I was tasked with creating a calculator that could:

- Input numbers & math operators(+,-,/,\*)
- Create a calculation history
- Prominately display calculator result
- Add functionality to clear out calculator using 'C' botton

### Project Requirements

[X] Make an input section

[X] The select type should be
mathamatical operation

[X] Create a '=' (submit) button is an equalizer

[X] We send what we captured from the input sections when we press
the submit button via a POST.

[X]Create a c button that clears the input fields

[X]Create a +,-,\*,/ button that clears the input fields

[X]Create a 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 button

[X] Keep a historical record of all math operations and solutions on the server. Display a list of all previous calculations on the page when it loads using a GET request. Update the list when a new calculation is made.

### Stretch Goals

[x] Only allow the POST call to happen if all necessary input is ready.

[X]_Data integrity is superfluously important! Sometimes users hit the "go button" without fully inputting the needed fields. Show an alert if they left something empty and don't send bad or incomplete data to the server._

[X]- Allow a user to clear the history by clicking on a button. Technically this shouldn't be a GET or a POST. Look into making a DELETE request!

[X] _GETs are used to, well, get information from the server. POSTs are used to send new info to the server. DELETEs are used for, you guessed it, deleting info already on the server._
